## Changelog

### 19.0.1.4.0 — 2026-04-14

Documentation and branding.

- Replace the plugin icon with the official **Raiffeisen Giebelkreuz**
  brand mark (yellow square with the crossed horse-head gable cross),
  cropped and centered on a clean 128×128 square.
- Add **DinaCard** to the supported brands list throughout the
  Odoo Apps Store description (`static/description/index.html`).
- Add a **Documentation** section linking to the official RaiAccept
  API reference at https://docs.raiaccept.com/index.html, both in
  README and in the Apps Store description.

### 19.0.1.3.0 — 2026-04-14

Brand display polish.

**Fixes**

- Link the provider to both the primary `Card` method **and** each
  accepted brand (Visa, Mastercard, DinaCard).
  Linking only the primary hid the brand icons at checkout; linking
  only the brands caused Odoo's `_get_compatible_payment_methods`
  to drop the Card method with "no supported provider available".
  Both are required.
- Pre-pad the DinaCard PNG onto a transparent 3:2 canvas (318×214)
  so Odoo's Image-field resize produces a 64×43 icon, matching the
  dimensions of Visa/Mastercard. Previously the
  DinaCard icon was rendered ~25% shorter than its neighbours and
  the text was unreadable.

### 19.0.1.2.0 — 2026-04-14

Payment brand coverage update.

**Improvements**

- Declare explicit brand list on the Raiffeisen provider: **Visa,
  Mastercard, DinaCard**. Previously the provider
  only linked to the generic `Card` method, so the Odoo brand pills
  on checkout/config views were empty.
- Ship **DinaCard** (Serbian national card scheme, operated by NBS)
  as a brand record. Odoo core does not include DinaCard by default;
  this module now creates it as a child of the `Card` method with a
  bundled logo asset under `static/src/img/dinacard.png`. Merchants
  on Raiffeisen RaiAccept in Serbia can now show a DinaCard pill
  alongside Visa/Mastercard at checkout.

### 19.0.1.1.0 — 2026-04-14

First production-tested release. This version has been validated end-to-end
on a live Odoo 19 e-commerce site with real sandbox transactions.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix `AttributeError: 'res.partner' object has no attribute 'mobile'`.
  Odoo 19 merged `partner.mobile` into `partner.phone`; the module now
  uses `phone` for both the `phone` and `mobilePhone` fields in the
  RaiAccept consumer payload.
- Fix HTTP 400 Bad Request on `/orders` caused by oversized `state`
  field. RaiAccept validates `billingAddress.state` / `shippingAddress.state`
  to 0–3 characters. The module now reads `res.country.state.code`
  (e.g. `RS-00`), strips the country prefix, and omits the field entirely
  if a short code cannot be produced.
- Fix amount being inflated 100× for RSD orders. RaiAccept treats RSD
  as a zero-decimal currency — sending 82500 was being displayed as
  "82,500.00 RSD" instead of "825.00 RSD". A new
  `_raiffeisen_minor_unit_factor(currency)` helper returns 1 for RSD
  and 100 for EUR, applied in all three places where the module
  computes minor units (order payload, status verification, refund).
- Fix customers landing on a blank RaiAccept "unexpected error" page.
  The redirect form uses `method="get"`, which caused browsers to drop
  the query string on the RaiAccept session URL (`?token=...&session=...`).
  The module now parses the redirect URL with `urlparse`, passes the
  path as `api_url` and the query parameters as hidden inputs via
  `url_params`, so the GET form submission reconstructs the full URL.
- Fix double-slash in callback URLs (`https://site.rs//payment/...`)
  by stripping the trailing slash from `get_base_url()`.

**Improvements**

- On HTTP 4xx/5xx responses, the module now logs the full outgoing
  request payload and the RaiAccept response body, and surfaces a
  truncated copy of the response body in the user-facing `ValidationError`
  so merchants can diagnose validation failures without digging into
  `journalctl`.
- Provider icon (`image_128`) and Apps Store assets updated to the
  official Raiffeisen "Giebelkreuz" brand mark and a clean Raiffeisen
  Visa card artwork.
- `available_country_ids` on the provider record now defaults to a
  curated list of 15 SEE/CEE + core EU markets, so RaiAccept only
  appears at checkout for customers with shipping addresses in those
  countries.

### 19.0.1.0.0 — 2026-04-13

Initial release. Full RaiAccept API integration, RSD/EUR settlement,
partial & full refunds, Cyrillic transliteration, webhook with
authoritative amount/currency verification, sandbox/production
credential split.
